<<What do you want to do?>>
	I want to model the crypt
<<Why?>>
	So I can play with the dynamics and see what if anything leads to serrations/other pathological indicators
<<How will you do that?>>
	Work out how to model a healthy crypt and then introduce "mutations"
<<Ok then, how does a healthy crypt work?>>
	A healthy crypt has a basement membrane. The epithelial cells sit on the BM. The BM is roughly test tube shaped.
	The base of the tube is attached to the muscularis mucosa which cups around the base.
	Around the BM is a pericryptal fibroblast sheath (Fibroblasts produce the stroma i.e. the ECM and collagen). Between crypts are stromal cells.
	The PCFS produces Wnt which gets into the crypt somehow
	{How does Wnt get into the crypt from outside the BM?}
	<<What does the Wnt do?>>

	There are at least 5 types of cell in the crypt: 
		Paneth cells, Lgr5+ cells -> both are stem -ish and are found in the bottom of the crypt
		Goblet cells -> these produce mucus (confirm, (true))
		Enterocytes/Coloncytes: Columnar Absorptive cells that produce ezymes for digestion
		Enteroendocrine Cells: Release hormones to regulate digestive enzymes

	Transit Amplifying cells:
		Occupy the lower two thirds (not exactly the bottom, but must appear there)
		They proliferate and move up the crypt wall, at a certain height, they are termnially differentiated and stop dividing
		They become Paneth, Goblet, Colono, or Enteroendocrine
	<<How do they know to stop dividing?>>
	{How do they know what to become?}
	<<What makes them move up the crypt?>>
		Mitotic pressure is suggested i.e. the force of new cells squeezing their way in between
	{What physical properties do the different cells have?}

<<Ok, so what do these pathological crypts look like?>>
	There are several types of polyps that contain pathological crypts
	<<Do we know that the polyps are created by the crypts going rogue, or are the rogue crypts a symptom of the polyps?>>


<<What can you model?>>
	In Chaste I can model the interaction force between cells (this ultimately determines cell shape), the cell cycle, signal gradients, cell death, 
	hopefully cell migration, cell mutations, cell types
<<What can't you model?>>
	3D things, membranes in their own right (done with forces or regular sized cells), genes and genetic mutations
	<<What limitations does this impose>>
		We need to approximate to 2D, we need to know the resultant cellular level effects of gene mutations
	<<What are the consequnces foryour research, your model and eventual results?>>
		I need to do a lot of digging to find the cellular level effects, they are not easy to find
		The model needs to be validated somehow, i.e. that 2D is good enough to represent the 3D real world


	{How can you model cell migration?}
